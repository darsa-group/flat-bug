Dear **XYZ**,
We are currently building a general deep-learning model to detect a variety of insects on flat surfaces. Our goal is to provide the community with a generic and readily-usable tool to extract a large number of insect instances, that may vary taxonomically,  in size and overlap, from (very) large images. In order to increase our scope, we are trying to cover multiple use cases in our dataset, which, so far, includes images of sticky cards, moth traps, and specimens in ethanol...  We would be very happy to discuss our project and share our models/progress.

Given **XWYZYWZY**, we were hoping you would have and agree to share some images.  Specifically, we would need anything between 10 and 100 raw images (we would likely annotate them ourselves).  Ideally, you would be able to share the material under a Creative Commons licence upon publication of our tool.  Naturally, we would acknowledge you (and relevant contributors) and cite your related work.

Many thanks,
