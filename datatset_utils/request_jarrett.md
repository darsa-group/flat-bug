Dear Jarrett, 

It was great to meet you (online) a few weeks back!

I am reaching out about something slightly unrelated… Some colleagues and I are currently developing a general deep-learning model (currently affectionately called “flat-bug”) to detect a variety of insects on flat surfaces. Our goal is to provide the community with a generic and readily-usable tool to extract a large number of insect instances, that may vary taxonomically, in size, and in overlap, from (very) large images.

In order to increase the model’s scope, we are trying to assemble a dataset covering multiple use cases, which, so far, includes almost 10 datasets of sticky cards, moth traps, specimens in ethanol, etc. We would be very happy to discuss our project and share our models/progress at any stage!

I looked at your paper and realized some of the data you have been working with fit very well into the chosen domain. The paper seems to say that the images are available online, but I couldn’t find them on the OSF page. Perhaps I missed something?

Given the possible benefits of a general insect detection model for you and the wider community, we were hoping you might agree to share some images. Specifically, we would need anything between 10 and 100 raw images (we would likely annotate them ourselves, but your segmentation data could also be useful…). Ideally, you would be able to share the material under a Creative Commons licence upon publication of our tool. Naturally, we would acknowledge you (and relevant contributors) and cite your related work.

We look forward to hearing your thoughts,

Thanks and best wishes,

Jamie and Quentin
